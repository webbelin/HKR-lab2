# Lab 2 - Javascript for web development
Kristianstad University

Individual assignment

## Project description
In the JavaScript for Web Development course at Kristianstad University, I created a simple, responsive portfolio website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The portfolio website itself, built with HTML and CSS, was created a year earlier in Lab 1, when I took the same course. Lab 2, on the other hand, focused on the challenge of integrating JavaScript into the form, including tasks like validating form fields and displaying error messages.
